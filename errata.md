# Errata for [*Mathematics of Epidemics on Networks*](http://www.springer.com/book/9783319508047)

This errata is limited to errors that are significant enough to cause confusion.

If you believe you have found an error:
 - If it is a minor typo that won't cause confusion for others (e.g., obvious misspelling, inconsequential punctuation error), please report it [here](https://github.com/springer-math/Mathematics-of-Epidemics-on-Networks/issues/9)
 - If it is major enough that it should be on this page, please check if it is already on this list and if not open a new issue [here](https://github.com/springer-math/Mathematics-of-Epidemics-on-Networks/issues) (use the green "New Issue" button). 

## Acknowledgments

- "\epsilon_2" should be "Matilda"

## Chapter 1 

## Chapter 2 

- In Proposition 2.4, in equations for k=1,...,N-1, the value Y_2^0 should be interpreted as the same as Y^0 and Y_1^{N}  should be interpreted as the same as Y^N.

## Chapter 3

## Chapter 4

 - In Figure 4.7c: \tau is actually 1.1\tau_c, not 1.2\tau_c

 - In Figure 4.11: \tau is not 2\tau_c.  It is actually 1.5 \tau_c = 1.5 \gamma/ \<K\>  (the factor of
2 should be 1.5)

## Chapter 5 
- In Figure 5.2c the label 1.2\tau should be 1.1\tau.

## Chapter 6 

- In Figure 6.7, it was not made clear that the percolation is performed by taking a single network for each N, giving each edge a weight uniformly in (0,1) and then as $p$ decreases from $1$, removing an edge when $p$ crosses its weight.

- equation 6.8a, \xi should be \zeta.

- displayed equation for example 6.3 \xi should be \zeta

## Chapter 7

- On page 255, in the last paragraph of the introduction, it should note that the (PW) model is system (5.15), the ED model is system (5.38) and the EBCM model is system (6.12).
