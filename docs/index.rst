Welcome to Epidemics on Networks's documentation!
=================================================


Epidemics on Networks (EoN) is a Python module that provides tools to study 
the spread of SIS and SIR diseases in networks.  The tools fall into two broad 
categories: either they are used for stochastic simulation or they are used to 
solve analytic ODE models.  This is based on the book 

  `Mathematics of Epidemics on Networks: from Exact to Approximate Models`_ 

The package is built using tools from NetworkX_.
